	<p>04/05/2020 Site created out of scraps of my university project</p>
	<p>05/05/2020 Moved to domain naturalnonsense.digital, added icons, started filling up the <i>arcade stash.</i></p>
	<p>06/05/2020 added twitter link, button animations, background, changed the logo.</p>
	<p>11/06/2020 after a long dealy (due to my preparation for the exams), added a 88x31 button, made the arcade stash logo (beta) and the IIDX/BMX button graphic. Changed background to CLASSIC GEOCITIES STARS. NO SHAPE / NO TASTE. Changed music in index and arcade stash home. Added icons to all buttons in arcade stash home.</p>
	<p>29/11/2020 Long time, no see! Well, a lot has actually happened: I moved thewebsite to github pages because I didn't feel like paying $5 a month for Neocities Supporter (i feel bad yeah), but also i fixed the annoying silence inbetween the loops of index BGM (atleast i was able to reduce it somewhat). Removed enpty links which lead to pages I did not care to create or put more content in.</p>
